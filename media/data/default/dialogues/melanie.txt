#m "Hey. I'm glad I was able to find you. I guess our intel was right. You okay?"
#m Melanie|"Yeah. I'm fine. I'm tired of all this travelling. I need somewhere secure with people. Friendly people, that is."
#m "I'm part of a safezone community in the region and we're looking for new members. Would you like to join us?"
#m Melanie|"Sure. I could definitely be of use. It's not like there are hospitals anymore."
