#name Full Capacity
#desc "Recently, we cleared a horde of infected and went through a lot of our reserve ammunition. If a group that large ever comes our way again, we won't be able to take it down. I need you to locate as much ammo as you can find and bring it back to me as quick as possible. Check army locations, police stations and other buildings. Corpses might also have bullets in their pockets."

#desc When Captain Hess and I were fighting a group of infected at the checkpoint, we suffered heavy casualties. The only thing worse than seeing your fellow soldiers fall is having to put them down when they come back from the dead. I want to avenge the fallen and slaughter as many infected as possible, but I can't do it alone. I need you to go out there and show them what you're made of.

#name Dead Drop
#desc Our safe zone has been doing business with a nearby community. In exchange for rifles and more powerful weapons, we have provided water from our well. The dead drop is in a field nearby Rosewood, a little north of the army quarters where we found Doctor Ross. The duffle bag should be stashed nearby some hay bales. Locate it and open it up.

#desc Switching to a side arm without a holster can be an inconvenience. I want to make sure that everyone at this safe zone is able to defend themselves at a moments notice. Search police stations, gun stores and other places to find holsters and bring them back to me.

#desc Weapon attachments can level the playing field when dealing with hostile survivors. It's about time that we got our hands on some. Search gun stores, military locations and police stations and bring them back to me.
