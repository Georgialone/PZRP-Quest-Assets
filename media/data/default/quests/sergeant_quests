#desc "Recently, we cleared a horde of infected and went through a lot of our reserve ammunition. If a group that large ever comes our way again, we won't be able to take it down. I need you to locate as much ammo as you can find and bring it back to me as quick as possible. Check army locations, police stations and other buildings. Corpses might also have bullets in their pockets."

#desc When Captain Hess and I were fighting a group of infected at the checkpoint, we suffered heavy casualties. The only thing worse than seeing your fellow soldiers fall is having to put them down when they come back from the dead. I want to avenge the fallen and slaughter as many infected as possible, but I can't do it alone. I need you to go out there and show them what you're made of.
